# Dictionary-GUI
 
![basic layout](image1.jpg) 

This project is about a Graphical User Interface I built for an interactive dictionary using Python's Tkinter. The dictionary is relatively 
interactive as in if you misspell a word, the program suggests the closest correct word to the misspelled one. For example, if you typed in 
"comduter", the program would ask if your word is "computer".

If you have Python 3 in your machine, then you're good to go. Just download the json.data and front end.py and run the script. Note that "tkinter" is
a pre-installed module in Python.
